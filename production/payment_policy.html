<body>
  <h1>RechaGlobal Card Processing Policy</h1>
  <p>This Card Processing Policy ("Policy") explains how RechaGlobal, Inc. ("RechaGlobal," "we," "us," or "our") processes payments made through our website located at <a href="https://app.rechainglobal.com/production">https://app.rechainglobal.com/production</a> ("Website").</p>

  <h2>1. Acceptance of Payment Methods</h2>

  <p>We accept various payment methods for purchases made through the Website, including:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express, etc.)</li>
    <li>Debit cards with a Visa or Mastercard logo</li>
  </ul>
  <p>We reserve the right to add or remove accepted payment methods at any time without prior notice.</p>

  <h2>2. Payment Processing</h2>

  <p>We utilize a third-party payment processor to securely process your credit or debit card information. We do not store your full credit or debit card information on our servers. The payment processor adheres to Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) compliance standards to ensure the security of your card information.</p>

  <h2>3. Authorization and Verification</h2>

  <p>When you submit your payment information, we will authorize the transaction with your card issuer. Your card issuer will then verify the information and funds availability. If the authorization is successful, the transaction will be processed. If the authorization is declined, you will be notified, and the purchase will not be completed.</p>

  <h2>4. Order Verification and Billing</h2>

  <p>We will send you a confirmation email with your order details and receipt once your payment is authorized and processed. You will be billed for the total amount of your order, including any applicable taxes and shipping fees.</p>

  <h2>5. Refunds and Chargebacks</h2>

  <p>Our refund policy is available on a separate page on the Website. You can request a refund by contacting our customer support team. If a refund is approved, we will credit the original payment method used for the purchase.</p>
  <p>We may charge you a processing fee for chargebacks that are disputed and found to be invalid. </p>

  <h2>6. Security</h2>

  <p>We take the security of your payment information seriously. We use industry-standard security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or destruction. However, no security measures are foolproof, and we cannot guarantee the complete security of your information.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to this Policy</h2>

  <p>We may update this Policy from time to time by posting the revised version on the Website. You are responsible for checking this Policy periodically for any changes. By continuing to use the Website after the revised Policy is posted, you agree to be bound by the revised terms.</p>
